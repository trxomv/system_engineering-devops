### 📘 About This Repository

Welcome! 👋
This repository contains my projects from the System Engineering & DevOps track of the ALX Software Engineering Program.
Each project focuses on understanding Linux fundamentals, Bash scripting, user/group management, and file system operations.

The repository is organized into multiple directories, each containing its own tasks and a dedicated README that explains the director.

## 🧩 Modules Overview

### 🔹 [0x00-shell_basics](https://github.com/trxomv/system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x00-shell_basics/README.md)
Covers foundational Linux commands:
- `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, etc.
- Listing hidden files & long format
- Basic scripting execution
---
### 🔹 [0x01-shell_permissions](https://github.com/trxomv/system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x01-shell_permissions/README.md)
Learn how to:
- Switch users (`su`).
- View and modify file ownership.
- Apply permission modes (numeric + symbolic).
- Create controlled-access files/directories.
---
### 🔹 [0x02-shell_redirections](https://github.com/trxomv/system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x02-shell_redirections/README.md)
Covers shell redirection and file handling:
- Display and manipulate file contents (`cat`, `head`, `tail`).
- Redirect output to files and append content.
- Work with multiple files at once.
- Delete files by type (`.js` files) and manage special filenames.
- Save current directory state to a file.
---
### 🔹 [0x03-shell_variables_expansions](https://github.com/trxomv/system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/README.md)
This module explores the intricacies of Shell initialization files, variables, and expansions. Key concepts covered include:
* **Aliases:** Creating and managing command aliases.
* **Variables:** Understanding the difference between local and global (environment) variables, and how to use `export`.
* **Path Manipulation:** Modifying the `$PATH` variable to add new directories.
* **Arithmetic Expansions:** Performing mathematical operations (addition, division, exponentiation) directly within the shell using `$(( ))`.
* **Shell Commands:** Utilizing `source`, `printenv`, `set`, and `type`.
---
### 🔹 [0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing](https://github.com/trxomv/system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/README.md)
This directory focuses on building logic and control flow in Bash Scripting. The tasks are designed to master fundamental programming constructs in the shell environment:
* Looping Structures: Implementation and use of the three main loop types: `for`, `while`, and `until` to execute repetitive tasks efficiently.
* Conditional Statements: Utilizing `if`, `elif`, `else`, and the `case` statement to enable scripts to make decisions and execute different behaviors based on specific conditions (such as iteration count or variable value).
* File Testing and Parsing: Employing Bash's file test operators (e.g., `-e`, `-f`, `-s`) within conditional logic to check file properties (existence, type, size) and act upon the results.

Goal: To create robust and dynamic Bash scripts capable of handling various scenarios through controlled flow and logic.
---
### 🔹 [0x05-processes_and_signals](https://github.com/trxomv/system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x05-processes_and_signals/README.md)
This directory focuses on mastering Linux Process Management and Signal Handling within Bash scripting. The tasks are designed to provide a deep understanding of how the operating system manages execution and how to interact with it:
 * **Process Identification:** Learning to retrieve and manipulate Process IDs (PIDs) using various techniques to monitor script execution.
 * **Process Control:** Managing the lifecycle of processes, including creating background tasks and implementing different methods for process termination.
 * **Signal Handling and Trapping:** Utilizing the `trap` command to intercept and respond to Linux signals (such as SIGTERM and SIGINT), allowing scripts to exhibit custom behaviors instead of simply exiting.
 * **Graceful vs. Forceful Termination:** Understanding the critical differences between standard termination signals and the unmaskable SIGKILL (signal 9).
 
 **Goal:** To develop advanced system scripts capable of monitoring themselves, responding to external OS signals, and managing system resources efficiently.
