Welcome! 👋
This repository contains my projects from the System Engineering & DevOps track of the ALX Software Engineering Program.
Each project focuses on understanding Linux fundamentals, Bash scripting, user/group management, and file system operations.

The repository is organized into multiple directories, each containing its own tasks and a dedicated README that explains the director.
